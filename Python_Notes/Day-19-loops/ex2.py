# The while Loop
# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

# syntax: while condition:
#     body of while
# k = 0
# while k<1:
#     print(k)
# print('loop completed')


# i = 0
#
# while i>2:
#     print('loop start:')
#
# print('loop completed')
# loop completed


x = 0
while x<5:
    print('loop :',x)
    x+=1
print('loop completed')

# loop : 0
# loop : 1
# loop : 2
# loop : 3
# loop : 4
# loop completed
