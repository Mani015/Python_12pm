# What is Python?
# Python is an interpreted and general-purpose programming language
# that emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.

# indentation: Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
# Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

# print(a)

# Addtion:
x1 = 2
x2 = 3
print(x1 + x2)
# 5
