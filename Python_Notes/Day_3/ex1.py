
# Assignment operators
# In Python, Assignment operators are used to assigning value to the variable. Assign operator is denoted by = symbol.
# For example, name = "python" here, we have assigned the string literal ‘developer’ to a variable name.


# = (Assign)			        a=5Assign 5 to variable a						                a = 5
# += (Add and assign)		    a+=5Add 5 to a and assign it as a new value to a			    a = a+5
# -= (Subtract and assign)	    a-=5Subtract 5 from variable a and assign it as a new value to a 	a = a-5
# *= (Multiply and assign)	    a*=5Multiply variable a by 5 and assign it as a new value to a		a = a*5
# /= (Divide and assign)	    a/=5Divide variable a by 5 and assign a new value to a			    a = a/5
# %= (Modulus and assign)	    a%=5Performs modulus on two values and assigns it as a new value to a	a = a%5
# **=(Exponentiation and assign)a**=5Multiply a five times and assigns the result to a			    a = a**5
# //= (Floor-divide and assign)	a//=5Floor-divide a by 5 and assigns the result to a			    a = a//5
# Addition Assigment
x = 10
# print(x)
# 10

x+=2
# x = x + 2
# x = 10 +2

# print(x)
# 12

# Sub Assigment

x-=5
# x = x - 5
# x = 12 - 5
# print(x)
