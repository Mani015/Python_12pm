# Dictionary in Python is a collection of keys values, used to store data values like a map,
# which, unlike other data types which hold only a single value as an element.

# syntax: {key1:value1}


d1 = {1:'one',2:'two',3:'three'}
print(d1)
# {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}

print(type(d1))
# <class 'dict'>


# In Python, a dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‘comma’.
# Dictionary holds pairs of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value.
