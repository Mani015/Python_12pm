# How to Use the elif Statement in Python
# The elif statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence, and execute different code blocks depending on which condition is true. Here's the basic syntax:
#
# syntax:
# if condition1:
#     # code to execute if condition1 is true
# elif condition2:
#     # code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
# elif condition3:
#     # code to execute if condition1 and condition2 are false, and condition3 is true
# else:
#     # code to execute if all conditions are false


# if-elif-else
x = eval(input('Enter one number:'))
# x is 2
if 1==x:
    print(x,'Shiva kumar')
elif x == 2:
    print(x, 'is Sridhar')
elif x == 3:
    print(x, 'is Bhaskar')
elif x == 4:
    print(x, 'is Dhamu')
elif x == 5:
    print(x,'is Jittu')
elif x == 6:
    print(x, 'is vishal')
else:
    print(x,'no Students here')

#     The elif statement is short for "else if", and can be used multiple times to check additional conditions.
